      The NYC Parcel ATM is an art project conceived for data through design
      2024, an annual data art show in NYC. It surfaces all 22 years of NYC's

      PLUTO is a remarkable dataset. Used by urban planners, developers,
      researchers, and civic hackers, PLUTO is a digital palimpsest of evolving
      visions for the city. It offers a rich view into 20+ years of
      sociopolitical, economic, and regulatory history, as well as chronicling
      the Department of City Planning’s (DCP) evolving data collection methods.

      The interface you are looking at presents one interpretation of PLUTO. In
      the future, I hope to collect feedback and make the tool more useful to
      others. If you have any ideas, please reach out to me by
      <a href="mailto:raphlaude@gmail.com">&#9993; email</a>. And if you'd like
      to analyze the data yourself, check out the full
