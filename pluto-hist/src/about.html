            PLUTO is a remarkable dataset. Used by urban planners, developers,
            researchers, and civic hackers, PLUTO is a digital palimpsest of
            evolving visions for the city. It offers a rich view into 20+ years
            of sociopolitical, economic, and regulatory history, as well as
            chronicling the Department of City Planning’s (DCP) evolving data
            collection methods.

            The interface you are looking at presents one interpretation of
            PLUTO. In the future, I hope to collect feedback and make the tool
            more useful to others. If you have any ideas, please reach out to me
